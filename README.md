Technologies Used
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We used Materialize as our main CSS framework, so as to avoid using Bootstrap.
<br />
We also connected jquery and a script for out search button icon.
<br />
Our API's are the following:
* OMDB which was used for general information such as rating and release year
* Themoviedb which was used to grab the movie posters
* GoWatchIt which found where to watch the searched movie
